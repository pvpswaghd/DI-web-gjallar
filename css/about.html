                <h2>Origin of Project 'Fimbulwinter'</h2>
                <small>2030</small>
                <p>
                    Predecessor of the Gjallar Organization 
                    <br>
                    - Hope to make every effort to solve or prevent crises that could lead to the extinction of society through research and technology development. 
                    <br>
                    - Help humanity survive the three upcoming ‘Fimbulwinter.’ 
                    <br><br>
                    The Earth's population expanded unexpectedly and faced rapid 
                    depletion of various resources, and extreme weather conditions, 
                    resulting in food crises, species extinction, cultural fractures, 
                    and other health problems. At this time, governments around the world 
                    still insisted on promoting environmental policies of 
                    "relief and adaptation," but Mr. Oliviersum decided to 
                    take preparatory action to respond to the imminent crisis 
                    because he thought that it was a matter of survival. 
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Oliviersum invested the family's assets and secretly 
                    recruited many scholars and scientists to launch the 
                    ‘Fimbulwinter’ project, which was later also referred to as the 
                    'Harbinger of Doomsday' project.

                <h2>The 'First Winter'</h2>
                <small>2040 - 2050</small>
                <p>
                    During the 'First winter' period, while governments 
                    around the world continued to vigorously promote and 
                    implement various environmental measures, extreme weather 
                    conditions continued to intensify at an incredible pace. 
                    In most areas, daytime temperatures in summer reached 60 degrees 
                    Celsius, and the summer season extended to around six months. 
                    The sea ice in both polar regions was almost completely melting, 
                    and natural disasters such as wildfires and typhoons occurred frequently.  
                    <br><br>
                    The 'Fimbulwinter' self-financed rescue team went to various parts 
                    of the world to aid refugees and set up shelters.  At the same time, 
                    to prevent further intensification and worsening of extreme weather conditions, 
                    Project 'Fimbulwinter' established bases in the North and South Poles to 
                    artificially produce ice and slow down the melting rate of sea ice, 
                    to prevent the continued deterioration of the effects of global warming.

                <h2>The 'Second Winter'</h2>
                <small>2050 - 2060</small>
                <p>
                    During the 'Second winter' period, although the impact of the 'First winter' was controlled and did not intensify thanks to the efforts of the organization, the destruction caused by the extreme climate conditions prior to it brought about the 'Second winter'.  
                    <br><br>
                    The heatwaves caused farmlands to burn, along with the effects of other extreme weather, resulting in three core impacts of the Second winter: a food crisis caused by shortages, destruction and loss of historical buildings and cultural relics, and the extinction of animals and plants in extreme environments. 
                    <br><br>
                    To check the food crisis, Mr. Oliviersum developed concentrated food and distributed it for free to refugees in shelters. Although the taste and texture of this food were not great, it had a long shelf life, low cost, and was nutritious.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, to prevent the continued loss and destruction of various surviving historical relics, the organization's researchers worked hard during this period to collect and produce all kinds of 'seeds'. These 'seeds' replicated and backed up various human knowledge, data, cultural relics, and genetic information of various animals and plants.

                <h2>The 'Third Winter'</h2>
                <small>2060 - 2080</small>
                <p>
                    The 'Third winter' period was the most difficult and chaotic time. In addition to the follow-up effects of the 'First winter' and 'Second winter', human society also faced the depletion of various resources such as clean water, clean air, and fossil fuels. People in various shelters were about to face energy shortages and health threats. People around the world were in a panic, and conflicts and disputes were endless.  
                    <br><br>
                    At this critical moment when human society was about to collapse, Mr. Oliviersum stepped forward to unite everyone and work together to get through the harsh winter. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>「We are in this together. And together, we will overcome this.」</h2>
                    <br><br> 
                    As the organization was about to exhaust its resources and properties, under the direct command of Mr. Oliviersum, the organization would make a desperate attempt to send an exploration team to outer space to seek technological breakthroughs and solve the end-of-the-world crisis on Earth. 
                    <br><br>
                    In 2070, the organization began to build a space station in outer space, concentrating the most advanced equipment and resources on the station, focusing efforts on researching new breakthroughs, and backing up the seeds in a safe place. 
                    <br><br>
                    On July 21, 2073, the elite team selected by Mr. Oliviersum himself set off into outer space to carry out the 'Mission: Aurora', seeking a glimmer of hope for saving the human world in the 'Fimbulwinter' of humanity. After entrusting the exploration team with the important mission, Mr. Oliviersum stayed on Earth to oversee the overall situation. 
                    <br><br>
                    In 2078, after five years of exploration, the exploration team brought back core technology from the planet K-452b. Later, despite opposition from others, the elderly Mr. Oliviersum led the research team day and night in the half-finished space station to study the Enfilitus crystal brought back by the exploration team. Ultimately, through their efforts, the organization successfully developed new clean energy using the Enfilitus crystal and advanced facilities on the space station, and replaced the power supply facilities on Earth in a short period of time, solving the energy crisis. 
                    <br><br>
                    On March 14, 2080, Mr. Oliviersum, who was overwhelmed and overworked, passed away shortly after witnessing the birth of the new energy. But under the leadership of Mr. Oliviersum, human society finally found a glimmer of hope in the 'Fimbulwinter'. After experiencing this, the barriers between people gradually became smaller, and people tended to cooperate and trust each other more than ever before.

                <small>2085 - Present</small>
                <p>
                    In 2085, the space station replaced its solar panels with solar reflectors and expanded its energy area to continue researching the application of renewable energy and extraterrestrial substances brought back to Earth. 
                    <br><br>
                    From 2093 to 2103, the Earth's old energy system was completely replaced, and all citizens could enjoy free energy. By collecting genetic data from extraterrestrial planets, organizations replicated extraterrestrial organisms and plants to purify the polluted air and oceans on Earth. Humans no longer needed to wear oxygen masks or other protective gear when going outside. The organization will continue to systematically monitor and manage ocean resources and air quality. 
                    <br><br>
                    From 2103 to 2113, the space station expanded its planting area and researched gene planting to reintroduce extinct plants to Earth and establish sustainable agriculture. At the same time, genetic backup was used to revive various species and reconstruct the food chain, gradually restoring Earth's past biodiversity. Unexpectedly, raw materials for manufacturing panacea were discovered from the scales of extraterrestrial organisms, and plans were made to mass-produce panacea and popularize it in human society. 
                    <br><br>
                    From 2113 to 2123, the recovery project began to take effect, and the Earth's ecosystem even became better than before. The organization also began to gradually "plant" the "seeds" stored on the space station on Earth and set up exhibition halls and museums worldwide to revive Earth's culture.

                    2. Celebrating the completion of Earth's recovery efforts. 
                    <br><br>
                    3. Allowing human society to unite and treat others sincerely and equally, after experiencing the shadow of the Fimbulwinter. 
                    <br><br>
                    Celebrating the completion/achie2vement of some of the Sustainable Development Goals that humans set a century ago, including No poverty, Zero hunger, Good health and well-being, Clean water and sanitation, Affordable and clean energy, Sustainable cities, Climate Action, Life below water, Life on land, Peace, and Partnerships for the goals.
