              <h1>Phase 1</h1>
              <p>The Earth's population expanded unexpectedly and faced rapid depletion of various resources, and extreme weather conditions, resulting in food crises, species extinction, cultural fractures, and other health problems. At this time, governments around the world still insisted on promoting environmental policies of "relief and adaptation," but Mr. Oliviersum decided to take preparatory action to respond to the imminent crisis because he thought that it was a matter of survival.</p>

              <p>Mr. Oliviersum invested the family's assets and secretly recruited many scholars and scientists to launch the ‘Fimbulwinter’ project, which was later also referred to as the 'Harbinger of Doomsday' project. </p>

              <h1>Phase 2 - The First Winter</h1>
              <p>During the 'First winter' period, while governments around the world continued to vigorously promote and implement various environmental measures, extreme weather conditions continued to intensify at an incredible pace. In most areas, daytime temperatures in summer reached 60 degrees Celsius, and the summer season extended to around six months. The sea ice in both polar regions was almost completely melting, and natural disasters such as wildfires and typhoons occurred frequently. </p>

              <p>The 'Fimbulwinter' self-financed rescue team went to various parts of the world to aid refugees and set up shelters.  At the same time, to prevent further intensification and worsening of extreme weather conditions, Project 'Fimbulwinter' established bases in the North and South Poles to artificially produce ice and slow down the melting rate of sea ice, to prevent the continued deterioration of the effects of global warming.</p>

              <h1>Phase 3 - The Second Winter</h1>
              <p>During the 'Second winter' period, although the impact of the 'First winter' was controlled and did not intensify thanks to the efforts of the organization, the destruction caused by the extreme climate conditions prior to it brought about the 'Second winter'.  

                The heatwaves caused farmlands to burn, along with the effects of other extreme weather, resulting in three core impacts of the Second winter: a food crisis caused by shortages, destruction and loss of historical buildings and cultural relics, and the extinction of animals and plants in extreme environments. </p>

              <h1>Phase 4 - The 'Third Winter'</h1>
              <p>The 'Third Winter' period was the most difficult and chaotic time. In addition to the follow-up effects of the 'First Winter' and 'Second Winter', human society also faced the depletion of various resources such as clean water, clean air, and fossil fuels. People in various shelters were about to face energy shortages and health threats. People around the world were in a panic, and conflicts and disputes were endless. </p>

Later, despite opposition from others, the elderly Mr. Oliviersum led the research team day and night in the half-finished space station to study the Enfilitus crystal brought back by the exploration team. Ultimately, through their efforts, the organization successfully developed new clean energy using the Enfilitus crystal and advanced facilities on the space station, and replaced the power supply facilities on Earth in a short period of time, solving the energy crisis.</p>

But under the leadership of Mr. Oliviersum, human society finally found a glimmer of hope in the 'Fimbulwinter'. After experiencing this, the barriers between people gradually became smaller, and people tended to cooperate and trust each other more than ever before. </p>
